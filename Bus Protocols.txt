Bus Protocols and Bus Interfaces
===================================
1) Cortex MX processor bus interfaces are based on AMBA (advanced 
   microcontroller bus architecture) 

2) This specification governs the standard for on-chip communication
   inside the SoC

3) AMBA specification supports several bus protocols
    - AHB Lite (AMBA High Performance Bus)
    - APB (AMBA Peripheral Bus)

4) APB is used for private peripheral bus (PPB) access and some on-chip
   access and
