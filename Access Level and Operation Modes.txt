Operational mode of the processor
===================================
M0/M3/M4

Two operational modes:
1) Thread mode 
2) Handler mode

- Application code executes under "Thread mode", aka "User Mode".

- Exception handlers or Interrupt handlers will run under the "Handler mode".

- Processor starts with Thread mode


Access Level of the Processor
================================

1) Two Access levels
    a) Privileged Access Level (PAL) - Full access to processor specific resources or restricted registers
    b) Non-Privileged Access Level (NPAL) - Inverse of PAL

2) Default code will be ran on PAL

3) Handler Mode is always in PAL

4) Its possible to move to NPAL during Thread Mode, but cannot be moved out unless through Handler Mode

5) CONTROL registers of the processor to switch between access levels


Cortex M Processor Core Registers
================================

1) R0 to R12 (total 13) registers are general purpose

2) Core registers are 32 bits

3) Stack pointer is stored in register (R13)

4) Link register (R14) stores the return address of the next instruction for subroutines, function calls, and exceptions.

5) Program counter (R15) register contains the current program address

6) Program status register is a collection of three sub status registers
    a) Application Program Status Register (APSR)
    b) Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR)
    c) Execution Program Status Register (EPSR)

7) Non-memory mapped registers:
    Do not have unique address that allow access. Hence they are not part of the processor memory map - can only be accessed via assembly instructions.
